    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    x = q*Ef/(m*(omega_0**2-omega**2))
    
    q in [1.0,3.0]
    Ef in [1.0,3.0]
    m in [1.0,3.0]
    omega_0 in [3.0,5.0]
    omega in [1.0,2.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
