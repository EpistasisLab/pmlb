    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    Ef = sigma_den/epsilon*1/(1+chi)
    
    sigma_den in [1.0,5.0]
    epsilon in [1.0,5.0]
    chi in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
