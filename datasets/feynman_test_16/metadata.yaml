    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    E_n = sqrt((p-q*A_vec)**2*c**2+m**2*c**4)+q*Volt
    
    m in [1.0,5.0]
    c in [1.0,5.0]
    p in [1.0,5.0]
    q in [1.0,5.0]
    A_vec in [1.0,5.0]
    Volt in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
