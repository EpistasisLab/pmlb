    This is one state of a 2-state dynamic model of Lotka-Volterra dynamics. 

    $\dot{x} = 3  \cdot x - 2  \cdot x \cdot y - x^2$
    $ \dot{y} = 2 \cdot y - x \cdot y - y^2$

    It is adapted from Steven Strogatz's book "Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics".  
    Each strogatz ODE system can exhibit chaotic and/or nonlinear behavior. 
    For the purposes of modeling, these systems are simulated using initial conditions within stable basins of attraction. 
    The systems are simulated using simulink and matlab.
