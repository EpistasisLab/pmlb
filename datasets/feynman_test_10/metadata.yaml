    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    theta1 = arccos((cos(theta2)-v/c)/(1-v/c*cos(theta2)))
    
    c in [4.0,6.0]
    v in [1.0,3.0]
    theta2 in [1.0,3.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
