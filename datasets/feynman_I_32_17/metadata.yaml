    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    Pwr = (1/2*epsilon*c*Ef**2)*(8*pi*r**2/3)*(omega**4/(omega**2-omega_0**2)**2)
    
    epsilon in [1.0,2.0]
    c in [1.0,2.0]
    Ef in [1.0,2.0]
    r in [1.0,2.0]
    omega in [1.0,2.0]
    omega_0 in [3.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
