    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    Volt = 1/(4*pi*epsilon)*q/sqrt(r**2+d**2-2*r*d*cos(alpha))
    
    q in [1.0,5.0]
    r in [1.0,3.0]
    d in [4.0,6.0]
    alpha in [0.0,6.0]
    epsilon in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
