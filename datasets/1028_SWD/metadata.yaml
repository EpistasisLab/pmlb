    Social Workers Decisions
    The SWD data set contains real-world assessments of qualified social workers regarding the risk facing children if they stayed with their families at home.  
    This evaluation of risk assessment is often presented to judicial courts to help decide what is in the best interest of an alleged abused or neglected child.
