    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    f = exp(-((theta-theta1)/sigma)**2/2)/(sqrt(2*pi)*sigma)
    
    sigma in [1.0,3.0]
    theta in [1.0,3.0]
    theta1 in [1.0,3.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
