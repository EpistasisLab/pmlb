    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    alpha = sqrt(1+2*epsilon**2*E_n*L**2/(m*(Z_1*Z_2*q**2)**2))
    
    epsilon in [1.0,3.0]
    L in [1.0,3.0]
    m in [1.0,3.0]
    Z_1 in [1.0,3.0]
    Z_2 in [1.0,3.0]
    q in [1.0,3.0]
    E_n in [1.0,3.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
