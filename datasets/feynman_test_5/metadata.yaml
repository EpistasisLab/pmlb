    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    t = 2*pi*d**(3/2)/sqrt(G*(m1+m2))
    
    d in [1.0,3.0]
    G in [1.0,3.0]
    m1 in [1.0,3.0]
    m2 in [1.0,3.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
