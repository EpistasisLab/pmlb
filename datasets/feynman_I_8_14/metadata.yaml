    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    d = sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
    
    x1 in [1.0,5.0]
    x2 in [1.0,5.0]
    y1 in [1.0,5.0]
    y2 in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
