    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    Pwr = kappa*(T2-T1)*A/d
    
    kappa in [1.0,5.0]
    T1 in [1.0,5.0]
    T2 in [1.0,5.0]
    A in [1.0,5.0]
    d in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
