    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    U = G*m1*m2*(1/r2-1/r1)
    
    m1 in [1.0,5.0]
    m2 in [1.0,5.0]
    r1 in [1.0,5.0]
    r2 in [1.0,5.0]
    G in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
