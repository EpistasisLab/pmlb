dataset: first_principles_absorption
description: |
    A real-world dataset containing the absorption of light for a solution containing a specific molecule at different levels of concentration. The original publication has data for 4 different molecules, and here we include data from only one of them (`real_data/absorption/examples/example0.csv`), the one with highest number of samples.
