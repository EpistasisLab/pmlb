    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    v1 = (u+v)/(1+u*v/c**2)
    
    c in [1.0,5.0]
    v in [1.0,5.0]
    u in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
