    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    r = d*(1-alpha**2)/(1+alpha*cos(theta1-theta2))
    
    d in [1.0,3.0]
    alpha in [2.0,4.0]
    theta1 in [4.0,5.0]
    theta2 in [4.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
