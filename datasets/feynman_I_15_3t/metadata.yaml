    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    t1 = (t-u*x/c**2)/sqrt(1-u**2/c**2)
    
    x in [1.0,5.0]
    c in [3.0,10.0]
    u in [1.0,2.0]
    t in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
