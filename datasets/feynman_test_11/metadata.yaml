    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    I = I_0*(sin(alpha/2)*sin(n*delta/2)/(alpha/2*sin(delta/2)))**2
    
    I_0 in [1.0,3.0]
    alpha in [1.0,3.0]
    delta in [1.0,3.0]
    n in [1.0,2.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
