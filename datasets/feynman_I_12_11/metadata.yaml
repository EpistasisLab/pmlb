    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    F = q*(Ef+B*v*sin(theta))
    
    q in [1.0,5.0]
    Ef in [1.0,5.0]
    B in [1.0,5.0]
    v in [1.0,5.0]
    theta in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
