    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    f = mom*H/(kb*T)+(mom*alpha)/(epsilon*c**2*kb*T)*M
    
    mom in [1.0,3.0]
    H in [1.0,3.0]
    kb in [1.0,3.0]
    T in [1.0,3.0]
    alpha in [1.0,3.0]
    epsilon in [1.0,3.0]
    c in [1.0,3.0]
    M in [1.0,3.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
