dataset: horse_colic_surgery
description: 'Horses may experience abdominal pain (colic) for various reasons. Some
  of these reasons are life-threatening and require surgery, whereas others are related
  to problems that are inconvenient, but harmless. Wikipedia has a thorough introduction,
  which can be perused for additional information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_colic
  The data underlying this dataset is used in several tasks, notably to predict whether
  surgery is actually necessary (horse_colic_surgery), to prognosticate the outcome
  (horse_colic_outcome), and to predict the type of lesion (horse_colic_lesion_type)
  that is causing the problem. Compared to the full dataset, the received_surgery
  feature was removed, because of its relationship to the target.'

  type: binary
  description: Colic is a symptom of a range of conditions ranging from innocuous
    to life-threatening. Some conditions, but not all, require surgery. Here we attempt
    to predict whether the horse should have underwent surgery to resolve the colic.
  code: 0 = yes, 1 = no
features:
  - name: age_category
    type: binary
    description: Indicator for age category of the horse. Here young horses are horses
      less than 6 months old. This could be a misspecification in the original dataset,
      as horses reach adulthood at 5-6 years of age. All horses in the current dataset
      are marked as adult.
    code: 0 = adult, 1 = young
  - name: rectal_temperature
    type: continuous
    description: Rectal temperature measurement in degrees celsius. Normal temperatures
      are between 37.2 and 38.5 degrees. A higher temperature may indicate inflammation,
      whereas a lower temperature may indicate late shock.
  - name: heart_rate
    type: continuous
    description: Heart rate in beats per minute. Normal heart rates for adult horses
      are between 30-40 bpm, with athletic horses having heart rates as low as 20
      bpm.
  - name: respiratory_rate
    type: continuous
    description: Respiratory rate in breaths per minute. At rest a horse draws 8-10
      breaths per minute, but this may vary greatly.
  - name: extremity_temperature
    type: categorical
    description: Subjective interpretation of temperature in the extremities of the
      horse, as an indicator of peripheral circulation.
    code: 0 = normal, 1 = warm, 2 = cool, 3 = cold
  - name: peripheral_pulse
    type: ordinal
    description: Another subjective interpretation of peripheral circulation. A weak
      or absent pulse may indicate poor perfusion.
    code: 0 = increased, 1 = normal, 2 = reduced, 3 = absent
  - name: mucous_membrane_appearance
    type: categorical
    description: The colour of mucous membranes provides an indication of peripheral
      circulation. Normally, mucous membranes, such as those of the gums, are pink.
      Deviations from this colour may indicate circulatory compromise (cyanotic) or
      septicaemia (blood poisoning, bright red).
    code: 0 = normal, 1 = bright pink, 2 = pale pink, 3 = pale cyanotic, 4 = bright
      red, 5 = dark cyanotic
  - name: capillary_refill_time
    type: binary
    description: When a tissue is pressed, blood is displaced. After releasing the
      pressure, blood flows back within a few seconds, which is called the capillary
      refill time. This can be observed by watching colour return .to the tissue.
      The longer the capillary refill time, the more peripheral circulation is impacted.
    code: 0 = < 3 seconds, 1 = > 3 seconds
  - name: pain
    type: categorical
    description: A subjective assessment of the horse's behaviour and pain level.
    code: 0 = normal, 1 = depressed, 2 = intermittent mild pain, 3 = intermittent
      severe pain, 4 = continuous severe pain
  - name: peristalsis
    type: ordinal
    description: Evaluation of the level of bowel movement of the horse. A noticeable
      decrease in activity may indicate a distended gut or blood poisoning.
    code: 0 = hypermotile, 1 = normal, 2 = hypomotile, 3 = absent
  - name: abdominal_distension
    type: ordinal
    description: Abdominal distension is directly related to the amount of pain experienced
      by the horse. Severe abdominal distension usually requires surgery to relieve
      the pressure.
    code: 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe
  - name: nasogastric_tube_stomach_gas
    type: ordinal
    description: Horses cannot (normally) vomit or regurgitate. A nasogastric tube
      allows for siphoning off gas trapped in the stomach. The amount of gas can be
      assessed.
    code: 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = significant
  - name: nasogastric_tube_reflux_volume
    type: ordinal
    description: Horses cannot (normally) vomit or regurgitate. Aside from siphoning
      off gas, if any, nasogastric tubes can be used to remove excess fluid. In healthy
      horses, the amount of fluid drawn off this way is less than a liter. An intestinal
      obstruction may cause fluid to back up.
    code: 0 = none, 1 = < 1 liter, 2 = > 1 liter
  - name: nasogastric_tube_reflux_ph
    type: continuous
    description: The acidity of fluid drawn using the nasogastric tube can be measured.
      Normal acidity for gastric fluids in horses is 3-4. Acidity is measured on the
      pH scale.
  - name: rectal_feces_presence
    type: ordinal
    description: Rectal examination can establish the absence of feces, which is a
      likely indicator for an obstruction on the intestines.
    code: 0 = increased, 1 = normal, 2 = decreased, 3 = absent
  - name: rectal_examination
    type: categorical
    description: The main aim of a rectal examination is to identify abnormalities
      in the intestines, such as a distended small intestine.
    code: 0 = normal, 1 = other, 2 = firm feces in large intestine, 3 = distended
      small intestine, 4 = distended large intestine
  - name: red_blood_cell_count
    type: continuous
    description: The number of blood cells per volume. The normal range is 30 to 50.
      An elevated level of blood cells may indicate a compromised circulation or dehydration.
  - name: blood_protein
    type: continuous
    description: The level of protein in the horse's blood, in grams per deciliter.
      The normal range is 6.0 to 7.5 grams per deciliter. High blood protein levels
      may indicate dehydration.
  - name: abdominocentesis_appearance
    type: categorical
    description: Abdominocentesis (belly tap) can be used to assess the peritoneal
      fluid. This fluid should normally be clear in appearance. A cloudy appearance
      is likely caused by an increased number of cells or protein, whereas a serosanguinous
      (reddish) appearance indicates the presence of red blood cells and blood serum.
    code: 0 = clear, 1 = cloudy, 2 = serosanguinous
  - name: abdominocentesis_protein
    type: continuous
    description: The level of protein in the peritoneal fluid can be measured. High
      protein levels is indicative of a compromised peritoneum. The value is measured
      in grams per deciliter.
