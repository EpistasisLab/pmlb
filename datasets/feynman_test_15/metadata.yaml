    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    omega_0 = sqrt(1-v**2/c**2)*omega/(1+v/c*cos(theta))
    
    c in [5.0,20.0]
    v in [1.0,3.0]
    omega in [1.0,5.0]
    theta in [0.0,6.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
