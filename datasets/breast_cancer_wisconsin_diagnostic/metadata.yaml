dataset: breast_cancer_wisconsin_diagnostic
description: A fine needle aspiration can be obtained to substantiate findings of
  suspected breast cancer. The aspirate is then cytologically examined under a microscope,
  and scored by a physician. These findings form the features in the dataset. The
  presence or absence of breast cancer is subsequently established by biopsy for patients
  where a malignancy is suspected, and re-examination after several months to a year
  for likely benign findings. A biopsy is optional for likely benign cases as well.
  The underlying patient dataset (but not actual dataset) is used for breast_cancer_wisconsin_original,
  breast_cancer_wisconsin_diagnostic (current) and breast_cancer_wisconsin_prognostic
  datasets. In the current dataset, the fine needle aspirate images were digitised,
  and the nuclei were segmented. Each segmentation was then used to compute ten features.
  The mean, standard error and worst (average of three largest) values for each patient
  are used to predict malignancy of suspected breast cancer. The features are detailed
  in Street, Wohlberg and Mangasarian (1993).
