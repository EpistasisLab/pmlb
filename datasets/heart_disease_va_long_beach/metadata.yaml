dataset: heart_disease_va_long_beach
description: The diagnosis of heart disease relies upon a combination of clinical
  signs and test results. For a long time, invasive coronary angiography has been
  a gold standard for diagnosing heart disease. However, angiography is relatively
  complicated, costly and not without risk to the patient. Each instance represents
  a patient with suspected heart disease that underwent clinical tests and angiography.
  The task is to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on clinical
  signs and test results. This dataset comes from a well-known collection of heart
  disease datasets. Of these datasets the Cleveland dataset (from the Cleveland Clinic
  Foundation) is the most well-known and complete. The current dataset, from the (then)
  Veterans Administration medical center in Long Beach, has more missing values, notably
  for the fluoroscopy_vessels and thallium_stress_test features. The other datasets
  can be found under heart_disease_cleveland, heart_disease_hungarian and heart_disease_zurich.

  type: binary
  description: Presence or absence of coronary heart disease, in particular coronary
    insufficiency, as indicated by angiographic measurements of the arterial diameter
    of major vessels. A decrease in diameter of >50% in any major vessel is used to
    indicate the presence of heart disease.
  code: 0 = absent, 1 = present
features:
  - name: age
    type: continuous
    description: Age of the patient in years.
  - name: gender
    type: binary
    description: Gender of the patient.
    code: 0 = female, 1 = male
  - name: chest_pain_type
    type: categorical
    description: Type of chest pain reported by the patient. Chest pain be caused
      by insufficient blood flow to the cardiac muscle, in which case it is called
      angina.
    code: 0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic
  - name: resting_blood_pressure
    type: continuous
    description: Blood pressure measured upon admission, without exercise, in mmHg.
      Given the value range, most if not all measurements are systolic blood pressure.
  - name: serum_cholesterol
    type: continuous
    description: Cholesterol concentration in blood serum. High levels of cholesterol
      may lead to fatty deposits in the blood vessels. These in turn increase risk
      at coronary heart disease, heart attacks and stroke. Measured in mg/dl.
  - name: high_fasting_blood_sugar
    type: binary
    description: Blood glucose levels after fasting in mg/dl. Blood glucose levels
      of over 120 mg/dl are indicated as high.
    code: 0 = no, 1 = yes
  - name: resting_ecg_results
    type: categorical
    description: An electrocardiogram (ECG) records electric activity of the heart
      as it beats. Several heart conditions noticeably affect cardiac electric activity
      that can be observed by recording an ECG.
    code: 0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = probable or definite left ventricular
      hypertrophy
  - name: maximum_exercise_heart_rate
    type: continuous
    description: Maximum heart rate observed during exercise. Exercise tests are used
      to assess cardiac capacity (or lack thereof) under strain.
  - name: exercise_induced_angina
    type: binary
    description: Angina is a chest pain caused by reduced flow of blood to the heart
      muscle, i.e. ischemia. This can be more noticeable when exercising.
    code: 0 = no, 1 = yes
  - name: exercise_st_depression
    type: continuous
    description: The ST-segment of the electrocardiogram (ECG) relates to repolarisation
      of the ventricles. Cardiac injury or coronary insufficiency (which we are trying
      to predict) are common causes for depression of the ST-segment. Exercise can
      produce or further enhance this depression, and provide evidence for coronary
      insufficiency.
  - name: exercise_st_slope
    type: categorical
    description: Though a depression of the ST-segment in electrocardiograms (ECG)
      is usually a sign that something is wrong, it is not always indicative of coronary
      insufficiency. The shape of the ST-segment slope can further help eliminate
      potential causes.
    code: 0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping
  - name: fluoroscopy_vessels
    type: continuous
    description: Fluoroscopy uses X-ray imaging to provide real-time moving images,
      in this case of the heart and surrounding major vessels. This allows for detecting
      flow abnormalities, e.g. reduced flow. The number of major blood vessels with
      substantially reduced flow is measured.
  - name: thallium_stress_test
    type: categorical
    description: Perfusion of the heart muscle (myocardium) can be imaged using radionuclides.
      At the time the data were recorded myocardial perfusion was studied using Thallium-201
      based compounds. Perfusion defects - local decreases in blood flow to the myocardium
      - are assessed using this imaging. This can lead to finding no defects, a reversible
      defect (where the defect is visible during the stress test, but not at rest)
      or a fixed defect (defect is present during rest and the stress test).
    code: 0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect
