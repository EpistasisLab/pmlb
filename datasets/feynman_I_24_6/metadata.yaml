    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    E_n = 1/2*m*(omega**2+omega_0**2)*1/2*x**2
    
    m in [1.0,3.0]
    omega in [1.0,3.0]
    omega_0 in [1.0,3.0]
    x in [1.0,3.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
