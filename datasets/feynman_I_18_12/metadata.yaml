    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    tau = r*F*sin(theta)
    
    r in [1.0,5.0]
    F in [1.0,5.0]
    theta in [0.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
