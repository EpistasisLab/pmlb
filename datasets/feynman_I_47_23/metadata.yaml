    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    c = sqrt(gamma*pr/rho)
    
    gamma in [1.0,5.0]
    pr in [1.0,5.0]
    rho in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
