    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    j = -rho_c_0*q*A_vec/m
    
    rho_c_0 in [1.0,5.0]
    q in [1.0,5.0]
    A_vec in [1.0,5.0]
    m in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
