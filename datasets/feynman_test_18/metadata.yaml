    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    rho_0 = 3/(8*pi*G)*(c**2*k_f/r**2+H_G**2)
    
    G in [1.0,5.0]
    k_f in [1.0,5.0]
    r in [1.0,5.0]
    H_G in [1.0,5.0]
    c in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
