    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    k = sqrt(omega**2/c**2-pi**2/d**2)
    
    omega in [4.0,6.0]
    c in [1.0,2.0]
    d in [2.0,4.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
