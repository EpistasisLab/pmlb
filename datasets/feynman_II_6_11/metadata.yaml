    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    Volt = 1/(4*pi*epsilon)*p_d*cos(theta)/r**2
    
    epsilon in [1.0,3.0]
    p_d in [1.0,3.0]
    theta in [1.0,3.0]
    r in [1.0,3.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
