    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    v = mu_drift*q*Volt/d
    
    mu_drift in [1.0,5.0]
    q in [1.0,5.0]
    Volt in [1.0,5.0]
    d in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
