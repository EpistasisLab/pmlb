    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    A = (Z_1*Z_2*alpha*hbar*c/(4*E_n*sin(theta/2)**2))**2
    
    Z_1 in [1.0,2.0]
    Z_2 in [1.0,2.0]
    alpha in [1.0,2.0]
    hbar in [1.0,2.0]
    c in [1.0,2.0]
    E_n in [1.0,3.0]
    theta in [1.0,3.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
