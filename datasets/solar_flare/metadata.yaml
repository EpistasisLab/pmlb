dataset: solar_flare
description: Solar flares are large eruptions on the surface of the sun. Though the
  mechanisms are not fully understood, flares typically occur in regions with complex
  magnetic field line arrangements such as those around sunspots. Minor sun flares
  are relatively common and their high-energy radiation and particle streams have
  little to no effect on Earth. Extreme sun flares are more rare, but considerably
  more disruptive to communications. This dataset consist of descriptions of regions
  with sunspots recorded in 1978, together with the number of flares originating from
  these reasons. Note that we here focus on predicting C-class flares, as M- and X-class
  flares are considerably more rare, and the number of instances would make it impossible
  to predict such flares.

features:
  - name: sunspot_group_configuration
    type: categorical
    description: In this dataset groups of sunspots are categorised according to the
      modified Zürich system The configuration of sunspots increases in complexity
      and size from A to G. Class A is a unipolar group without any penumbras, and
      usually the initial or final stage of a group of sunspots. Class B is bipolar
      group without any penumbras. Class D-F are bipolar groups of increasing sizes
      and complexity. Finally class H is a unipolar group with penumbra.
    code: 0 = B, 1 = C, 2 = D, 3 = E, 4 = F, 5 = G, 6 = H
  - name: sunspot_largest_spot
    type: categorical
    description: Classification of the penumbra of the largest spot. The penumbra
      is the region around the central dark region. For group configurations A and
      B, there is no penumbra (X). R indicates a rudamentary penumbra. S, A, H, K
      classes categorizes size and shape of the penumbra, with S and A being small,
      H and K being large S and H being symmetric, and A and K being asymmetric.
    code: 0 = X, 1 = R, 2 = S, 3 = A, 4 = H, 5 = K
  - name: sunspot_distribution
    type: categorical
    description: Classifies the distribution of spots. In the modified Zürich system
      this classification is based on the outermost prominent spots. These also called
      leading and following spots, based on their position with regard to the sun's
      rotation vector. For group configurations A and H, distribution is not defined
      (X). Open (O) means that there are few, if any, spots between leading and following
      spots. Intermediate (I) indicates that are numerous spots between leading and
      following spots, but these lack fully formed penumbra.Compact (C) indicates
      that are numerous spots between the leading and following spots, with at least
      one other mature spot.
    code: 0 = X, 1 = O, 2 = I, 3 = C
  - name: sunspot_activity
    type: binary
    description: Assessment of activity of a sunspot group.
    code: 0 = reduced, 1 = unchanged
  - name: sunspot_evolution
    type: categorical
    description: Assessment of the evolution of a sunspot group. Decay means that
      the sunspot group is becoming less pronounced. A growing sunspot region, on
      the other hand, becomes more pronounced, with more and larger sunspots and penumbra.
    code: 0 = decay, 1 = stable, 2 = growth
  - name: recent_flare_activity
    type: categorical
    description: Indicator of flares observed in the sunspot region in the past 24
      hours.
    code: 0 = up to C-class flares, 1 = one M-class flare, 2 = more than one M-class
      flare or X-class flare
  - name: historically_complex_region
    type: binary
    description: Indicator of historical complexity of the sunspot group. The original
      description does not define when a sunspot group is considered to be complex,
      and what time period is considered. It may be assumed that complexity is assessed
      for the duration that the sunspot group existed up to the current observation.
    code: 0 = yes, 1 = no
  - name: historically_complex_region_recent
    type: binary
    description: Indicator of a sunspot region becoming complex within the current
      orbital rotation. Depending on the latitude of the group, this is a timeframe
      between roughly 25 (equator) and 38 days (polar region).
    code: 0 = yes, 1 = no
  - name: region_area
    type: binary
    description: Area of the sunspot group. It is not clear what cutoff is being used.
    code: 0 = small, 1 = large
  - name: largest_spot_area
    type: binary
    description: Area of the largest spot. In this dataset all largest spots are smaller
      than 5 degrees (diameter).
    code: 0 = up to 5 degrees, 1 = over 5 degrees
