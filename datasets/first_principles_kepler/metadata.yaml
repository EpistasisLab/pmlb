dataset: first_principles_kepler
description: |
  The Keppler dataset is based on the Kepler's third law of planetary motion. The features are the semi-major axis (a) and the period (P) of a planet's orbit, given by the equation:

  P^2 = k a^3

  Each row corresponds to a planet in the following order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and it is based on the data used by Kepler in 1618.
