    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    x = x1*(cos(omega*t)+alpha*cos(omega*t)**2)
    
    x1 in [1.0,3.0]
    omega in [1.0,3.0]
    t in [1.0,3.0]
    alpha in [1.0,3.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
