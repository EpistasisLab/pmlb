    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    E_n = g_*mom*B*Jz/(h/(2*pi))
    
    g_ in [1.0,5.0]
    h in [1.0,5.0]
    Jz in [1.0,5.0]
    mom in [1.0,5.0]
    B in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
