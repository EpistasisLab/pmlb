    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    Volt = q/(4*pi*epsilon*r*(1-v/c))
    
    q in [1.0,5.0]
    epsilon in [1.0,5.0]
    r in [1.0,5.0]
    v in [1.0,2.0]
    c in [3.0,10.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
