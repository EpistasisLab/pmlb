description: On the 10th of April 1912, the largest passenger liner of its time left
  Southampton on its maiden voyage to New York. This destination was never reached,
  as the Titanic struck an iceberg while crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Many people
  did not survive this disaster. The dataset contains characteristics of most of the
  passengers and crew on board the Titanic, as well as a survival indicator. Name
  and ticket number columns were dropped from the original dataset.
