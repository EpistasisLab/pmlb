    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    F = q/(4*pi*epsilon*y**2)*(4*pi*epsilon*Volt*d-q*d*y**3/(y**2-d**2)**2)
    
    q in [1.0,5.0]
    y in [1.0,3.0]
    Volt in [1.0,5.0]
    d in [4.0,6.0]
    epsilon in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
