    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    A = 1/(4*pi)*alpha**2*h**2/(m**2*c**2)*(omega_0/omega)**2*(omega_0/omega+omega/omega_0-sin(beta)**2)
    
    omega in [1.0,5.0]
    omega_0 in [1.0,5.0]
    alpha in [1.0,5.0]
    h in [1.0,5.0]
    m in [1.0,5.0]
    c in [1.0,5.0]
    beta in [0.0,6.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
