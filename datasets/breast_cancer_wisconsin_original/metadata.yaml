dataset: breast_cancer_wisconsin_original
description: A fine needle aspiration can be obtained to substantiate findings of
  suspected breast cancer. The aspirate is then cytologically examined under a microscope,
  and scored by a physician. These findings form the features in the dataset. The
  presence or absence of breast cancer is subsequently established by biopsy for patients
  where a malignancy is suspected, and re-examination after several months to a year
  for likely benign findings. A biopsy is optional for likely benign cases as well.
  The underlying patient dataset (but not actual dataset) is used for breast_cancer_wisconsin_original
  (current), breast_cancer_wisconsin_diagnostic and breast_cancer_wisconsin_prognostic
  datasets. Here we aim to predict malignancy of suspected breast cancer based on
  the cytological assessment.

  description: Benign or malignant finding, established after further investigations,
    e.g. through biopsy or re-examination after a few months.
  code: 0 = benign, 1 = malignant
features:
  - name: clump_thickness
    type: continuous
    description: The extent to which epithelial cell clumps in the fine needle aspirate
      were mono- or multilayered.
  - name: cell_size_uniformity
    type: continuous
    description: The degree to which epithelial cells are similarly sized.
  - name: cell_shape_uniformity
    type: continuous
    description: The degree to which epithelial cells have a similar shape.
  - name: marginal_adhesion
    type: continuous
    description: The degree of cohesion of the cells surrounding the epithelial clumps.
  - name: epithelial_cell_size
    type: continuous
    description: A measure of the diameter of the largest epithelial cells compared
      to that of red blood cells.The latter have a relatively constant diameter across
      patients.
  - name: bare_nuclei
    type: continuous
    description: The proportion of nuclei of epithelial cells that were not surrounded
      by substantial cytoplasma.
  - name: bland_chromatin
    type: continuous
    description: Chromatin is a complex of DNA and supporting protein. Chromatin is
      typically loosely coiled when the cell is not undergoing cell division, allowing
      for more tight packing of DNA, and regulating gene expression. This feature
      scores the degree to which it appears bland under the microscope, i.e. how homogenous
      it appears to be.
  - name: normal_nucleoli
    type: continuous
    description: The nucleolus is the part of the cell nucleus where ribosomes are
      produced and assembled. Ribosomes are the primary protein factories of cells,
      which create protein from amino acids based on genetic templates copied from
      the DNA. This feature scores the degree to which the nucleoli have an abnormal
      appearance.
  - name: mitoses
    type: continuous
    description: Mitosis is the process of cell replication, where one cell is divided
      into two daughter cells. More precisely, its the part of the cell cycle where
      already replicated chromosomal material is separated into two new nuclei. This
      feature scores the number of cells undergoing mitosis.
