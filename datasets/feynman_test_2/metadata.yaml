    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    k = m*k_G/L**2*(1+sqrt(1+2*E_n*L**2/(m*k_G**2))*cos(theta1-theta2))
    
    m in [1.0,3.0]
    k_G in [1.0,3.0]
    L in [1.0,3.0]
    E_n in [1.0,3.0]
    theta1 in [0.0,6.0]
    theta2 in [0.0,6.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
