dataset: auto_insurance_symboling
description: This dataset comes from a 1985 auto imports dataset, which was combined
  with car insurance data. The original dataset can be used to predict several targets.
  Here we use the dataset to predict the symbol of each car, which determines how
  risky each car is to insure. Other datasets that are based on the same data are
  auto_insurance_price and auto_insurance_losses. Compared to the original dataset,
  the normalised losses column was dropped.
