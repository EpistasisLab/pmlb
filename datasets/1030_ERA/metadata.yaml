    Employee Rejection / Acceptance
    The ERA data set was originally gathered during an academic decision-making experiment aiming at determining which are the most important qualities of candidates for a certain type of jobs. 
    Unlike the ESL data set which was collected from expert recruiters, this data set was collected during a MBA academic course.
    The input in the data set are features of a candidates such as past experience, verbal skills, etc., and the output is the subjective judgment of a decision-maker to which degree he or she tends to accept the applicant to the job or to reject him altogether (the lowest score means total tendency to reject an applicant and vice versa).
