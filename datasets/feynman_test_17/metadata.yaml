    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    E_n = 1/(2*m)*(p**2+m**2*omega**2*x**2*(1+alpha*x/y))
    
    m in [1.0,5.0]
    omega in [1.0,5.0]
    p in [1.0,5.0]
    y in [1.0,5.0]
    x in [1.0,5.0]
    alpha in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
