    Lecturers Evaluation
    The LEV data set contains examples of anonymous lecturer evaluations, taken at the end of MBA courses. 
    Before receiving the final grades, students were asked to score their lecturers according to four attributes such as oral skills and contribution to their professional/general knowledge. 
    The single output was a total evaluation of the lecturerâ€™s performance.
