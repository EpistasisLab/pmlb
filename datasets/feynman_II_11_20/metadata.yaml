    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    Pol = n_rho*p_d**2*Ef/(3*kb*T)
    
    n_rho in [1.0,5.0]
    p_d in [1.0,5.0]
    Ef in [1.0,5.0]
    kb in [1.0,5.0]
    T in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
