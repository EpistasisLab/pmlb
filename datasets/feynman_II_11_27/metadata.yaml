    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    Pol = n*alpha/(1-(n*alpha/3))*epsilon*Ef
    
    n in [0.0,1.0]
    alpha in [0.0,1.0]
    epsilon in [1.0,2.0]
    Ef in [1.0,2.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
