    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    K = E_n/(1+E_n/(m*c**2)*(1-cos(theta)))
    
    E_n in [1.0,3.0]
    m in [1.0,3.0]
    c in [1.0,3.0]
    theta in [1.0,3.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
