dataset: strogatz_shearflow1
description: |
    This is one state of a 2-state dynamic model for shear flow. 
    
    x' = cot(y) * cos(x)

    It is adapted from Steven Strogatz's book "Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics".  
    Each strogatz ODE system can exhibit chaotic and/or nonlinear behavior. 
    For the purposes of modeling, these systems are simulated using initial conditions within stable basins of attraction. 
    The systems are simulated using simulink and matlab.
