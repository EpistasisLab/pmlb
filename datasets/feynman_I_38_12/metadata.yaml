    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    r = 4*pi*epsilon*(h/(2*pi))**2/(m*q**2)
    
    m in [1.0,5.0]
    q in [1.0,5.0]
    h in [1.0,5.0]
    epsilon in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
