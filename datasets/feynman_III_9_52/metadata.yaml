    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    prob = (p_d*Ef*t/(h/(2*pi)))*sin((omega-omega_0)*t/2)**2/((omega-omega_0)*t/2)**2
    
    p_d in [1.0,3.0]
    Ef in [1.0,3.0]
    t in [1.0,3.0]
    h in [1.0,3.0]
    omega in [1.0,5.0]
    omega_0 in [1.0,5.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
