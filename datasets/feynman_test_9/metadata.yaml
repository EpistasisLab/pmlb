    A synthetic physics model from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.         
    This is the version of the model with units.
    Formula and simulated variable ranges given below. 
    
    Pwr = -32/5*G**4/c**5*(m1*m2)**2*(m1+m2)/r**5
    
    G in [1.0,2.0]
    c in [1.0,2.0]
    m1 in [1.0,5.0]
    m2 in [1.0,5.0]
    r in [1.0,2.0]
    
    Note the original data has been down-sampled to 100,000 rows (see source).
