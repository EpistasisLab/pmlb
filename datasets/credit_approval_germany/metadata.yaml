dataset: credit_approval_germany
description: Banks are exposed to a financial risk when offering credit to a customer.
  The customer may not be able to or unwilling to repay the credit in full. Hence,
  banks have to judge how risky a credit application is. This dataset contains (mock?)
  data for credit applications. The objective is to assess the credit risk of each
  applicant. Note that this dataset is several decades old, and is likely outdated.
