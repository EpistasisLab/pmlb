  The Tully-Fisher relation is an empirical correlation between the luminosity of a spiral galaxy and its rotational velocity, named after astronomers Richard Tully and J. Richard Fisher, who first proposed it in 1977, based on physical principles.
  The data was extracted from Fig. 5(a) of Tully and Fisher publication.

  The original relation is: L \propto \Delta V(0)^{2.5}
